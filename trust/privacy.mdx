title: "Privacy"

We are committed to transparency regarding how member data is collected, processed, and stored inside your loyalty program. Our privacy framework is designed to help you maintain compliance with global regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD.

### Data Minimization

We give you the flexibility to collect only the attributes necessary to facilitate your members' loyalty experience, such as:

- **Identity Data**: External ID, name, and email address.
- **Demographic Data**: Date of birth, used specifically for birthday-related campaigns.
- **Transactional Data**: [Sales](https://www.google.com/search?q=/run/sales) history and [Redemption](https://www.google.com/search?q=/run/redemptions) patterns used to determine tiering and rewards.

### AI

To leverage the power of frontier LLMs while maintaining member privacy, we implement the following safeguards:

- **PII Masking**: Before data is processed by an LLM, PII such as names and email addresses are masked or anonymized. The model operates on patterns rather than individual identities.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data processed by AI is used solely for the purpose of enhancing your program and is not shared with third parties for marketing.
- **Transparency**: All incentive processing outcomes are individually auditable, ensuring AI-driven personalization is compliant with your internal governance standards.

### Member Rights & Control

The platform provides tools to honor member privacy requests:

- **Right to Access**: Customer service personnel can view a member's full profile directly inside the app to fulfill access requests.
- **Right to Erasure**: When a member is deactivated, their data can be handled according to your organization’s retention and deletion policies.
- **Processing Restrictions**: Halt data processing for specific members in the case of a dispute or privacy review.
