Protecting the integrity of your loyalty program data is our highest priority. Fielo Loyalty, built on Pega Launchpad, employs a multi-layered security strategy to ensure that all data, including member and transactional data, remains secure.

### Infrastructure

As a cloud application built on Pega Launchpad, we inherit enterprise-grade security controls from a platform that is **zero-trust architected** and **secure by default**.

- **Physical Security**: Data is hosted in secure, Tier-1 cloud environments with 24/7 monitoring and physical access controls.
- **Network Isolation**: We utilize Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and advanced firewalls to isolate program data from unauthorized external access.
- **Compliance**: Pega Launchpad enjoys [over 20 security certifications](https://www.pega.com/trust), including **ISO 27001** and **SOC 2**.

### Data Protection

We employ industry-standard encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

- **Encryption in Transit**: All data moving between external systems of record and our API is encrypted using TLS 1.2+.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Databases storing member attributes, external IDs, and transaction histories are encrypted using AES-256.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Administratively, you can manage who has the authority to view each area of the app, ensuring the principle of least privilege.

### AI

When leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate insights and recommendations, we adhere to strict security protocols:

- **No Training Policy**: We use enterprise-tier API agreements with LLM providers. Your proprietary program data and member information are _never_ used to train the provider's foundation models.
- **Data Sandboxing**: LLM processing occurs within a secure, ephemeral environment. Data is sent for the specific task and is not stored by the LLM provider beyond the immediate session (Zero Data Retention where applicable).
- **Prompt Security**: All inputs sent to AI models are sanitized to prevent prompt injection attacks that could compromise application logic.
