A sale represents a purchase made by one of your customers. It is a core behavior that programs seek to influence. Different facets of sales can be incentivized, such as ticket size, frequency, product mix, and more. Sales are typically fed to Fielo from the external system of record via API, either in real time or by scheduled job.
