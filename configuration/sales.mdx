A sale represents a purchase made by one of your customers. It is a core behavior that programs seek to influence. Different facets of sales can be incentivized, such as ticket size, frequency, product mix, and more. Sales are typically fed to Fielo from an external system of record via API, either in real time or by scheduled job.

### Attributes

For small-scale testing purposes, sales can be created from the Sales page. Sales have the following attributes:

- _External ID_: This is a unique identifier for the sale. It typically originates in the external system of record. It is required.
- _Sale Date Time_: This is the day and time at which the sale occurred. Timeboxed incentives use it to determine whether the sale occurred within the incentive period. If left blank, it will be assumed that the sale occurred at the time it was registered inside Fielo.
- _Store_: This is the physical location at which the sale occurred. It is optional.
- _Store Code_: This is the unique identifier of the store at which the sale occurred. It is used to associate a store with the sale when creating the sale via API. It is optional.
- _Member_: This is the customer associated with the sale.
- _Member External ID_: This is the unique identifier of the member on the sale. It is used to associate a member with the sale when creating the sale via API.

- _Point of Sale ID_: This identifies the POS at which the sale occurred. It is optional.
- _Total Amount_: This is total amount paid on the sale. If sale items are included on the sale, this will be calculated as the sum of the line item amounts. If flat sales data is provided, this should be filled in when registering the sale inside Fielo.

If sale items are included on the sale, this will be calculated as the sum of the line item amounts of the sale items marked as incentivizable.
