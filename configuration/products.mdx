A product is something that can be referenced as a line item, or sale item, on a sale. If you plan to build incentives that target specific sale items, you must register corresponding products.

### Attributes

To add a product, navigate to the Products page and select **Create Product**. In addition to a name and description, products have the following attributes:

- _Product Code_: This is how a product will be identified on a sale item. It must be unique.
- _Brand_: Identifies the brand of a product for targeting by incentive rules. It is optional.
- _Category_: Identifies the product category for incentive rule targeting purposes. It is optional.
- _Incentivizable_: When enabled, the value paid for this product as a sale item on a sale counts towards that sale's _Incentivizble Amount_.

### Status

The status of a product is always _Open-Active_. Products no longer in use can be deleted.
