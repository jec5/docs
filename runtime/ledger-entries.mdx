title: "Ledger Entries"
---

Ledger entries record every accrual and deduction of currencies in your program. Their purpose is to update a member's currency balance. Positive ledger entries are often assigned expiration dates. Ledger entries can be produced by incentive rules processing, redemptions, manual currency adjustments, and currency expiration.

The main place you can inspect ledger entries is on a member's detail page. You can also find ledger entries on the items that created them, such as incentivized activities (e.g. sales) and redemptions.

### Attributes

Ledger entries have the following attributes:

- _Type_: **Accrual** means a positive entry resulting from the processing of an incentive rule. **Redemption** means a negative entry resulting from a member redeeming currency for a reward. **Adjustment** means a manual addition or removal of currency by an admin. **Expiration** means a negative entry resulting from the expiration of an accrual or positive adjustment.
- _Member_: The member whose balance was updated.
- _Currency_: The currency corresponding to the balance that was updated.
- _Incentive Rule_: If the entry is an accrual, this is the incentive rule which generated it.
- _Sale_: If the entry is the result of an incentive rule on Sale, this is the corresponding sale.
- _Event_: If the entry is the result of an incentive rule on Event, this is the corresponding event.
- _Redemption_: If the entry is of type "Redemption", this is the corresponding redemption.
- _Expiration Ledger Entry_: If the entry is of type "Expiration", this is the positive entry whose remaining balance has been expired.
- _Member Balance Snapshot_: The resulting balance of the member immediately following the insertion of this entry.
- _Currency Awarded_: The amount of currency added or removed.
- _Currency Available_: The amount of currency still available for use (i.e. not already used or expired). For negative entries, this will always be 0.
- _Currency Used_: The amount of currency that the member has used, such as in redemptions. For negative entries, this will always be blank.
- _Currency Expired_: The amount of currency that was consumed due to expiration. For negative entries and positive entries prior their expiration date, this will be blank.
- _Create DateTime_: The date and time at which the entry was inserted.
- _Expiration Date Time_: The date and time at which the positive entry is set to expire. If blank, either the entry is a deduction or it does not expire.

### Statuses

Ledger entries can be in one of three statuses:

- _Open-Available_: The entry is positive, has available balance and does not have an expiration date.
- _Open-AvailableWithExpiry_: The entry is positive, has available balance and has an expiration date in the future.
- _Resolved-Closed_: The entry is negative (redemption, expiration or negative adjustment) or the entry is positive with no available balance remaining.
