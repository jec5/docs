A program encapsulates a community of members that you want to influence, as well as how you target and reward them. To use Fielo, you must have at least one a program.

To create a program, navigate to the Programs page and select **Create Program**. In addition to a name and description, programs have the following settings:

- _Time Zone_: This is the time zone by which ledger entries and redemption items will be marked as expired. It accepts the cannonical identifiers as described by the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) standard.
- _Redemption Ceiling Tiebreaker_: If using redemption ceiling rules, this determines whether, when multiple rules apply, which rule will prevail. **Lowest Wins** means the lowest ceiling will be returned, while **Highest Wins** means the highest ceiling will be returned.
- _Currencies_: The currencies selected will be usable in the program. Members will not be able to accrue any unselected currencies.

Programs can be in one of two statuses:

- _Open-Active_: The program's rules will be processed against input data related to its members.
- _Resolved-Inactive_: The program's rules will not be processed.
