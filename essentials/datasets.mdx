A data set defines a structured flow of data that will be tracked and incentivized upon. Fielo Loyalty comes with two data sets out of the box:

- _Sale_: Represents a sale that has been finalized by a member. It can contain one or more sale items.
- _Event_: Represents an event that is based on a calendar occurrence (e.g. birthday, program anniversary) or received from an external system (e.g. spin-and-win result).

### Criteria

You can refine what data from your data set is eligible to be incentivized by adding criteria. When doing so, only data that passes through this filter will be processed against your program's incentive rules.

To add or modify a data set's criteria, access the three-dot menu from the details pane and select **Edit Criteria**. From there, you can add one or more criteria to filter based on the available attributes of the object type. You can also specify whether _All criteria must match_ or _Any criterion can match_.

### Statuses

Data sets can be in one of two statuses:

- _Open-Active_: Input data related to this data set will be processed.
- _Resolved-Inactive_: Input data related to this data set will not be processed.
