A program encapsulates a community of members that you want to influence, as well as how you target and reward them. To use Fielo, you must have at least one a program.

### Settings

To create a program, navigate to the Programs page and select **Create Program**. In addition to a name and description, programs have the following settings:

- _Time Zone_: The time zone that will be applied to input data during rules processing, in order to determine whether the incentivizable activity occurred inside an incentive's timebox. It will also be used to when marking ledger entries and redemption items as expired. It accepts the cannonical identifiers as described by the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) standard. If blank, UTC (GMT) will be assumed.
- _Redemption Ceiling Tiebreaker_: If using [Redemption Ceiling Rules](/build/redemption-ceiling-rules), this determines whether, when multiple rules apply, which rule will prevail. **Lowest Wins** means the lowest ceiling will be returned, while **Highest Wins** means the highest ceiling will be returned.
- _Currencies_: The currencies selected will be usable in the program. Members will not be able to accrue any unselected currencies.

### Statuses

Programs can be in one of two statuses:

- _Open-Active_: The program's rules will be processed against input data related to its members.
- _Resolved-Inactive_: The program's rules will not be processed.
