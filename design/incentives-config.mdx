title: "Incentives"
---

Incentives contain the rules that define how members get rewarded for participation in your program. They can be open-ended or timebound. They can be for all members or only a subset of members. They can reward outcomes, like sales or tier upgrades, or on a time schedule, like birthdays or program anniversaries. Rewards can take the form of virtual currency, like points, or instant rewards, like catalog items or vouchers.

### Configure an Incentive

To start building an incentive, navigate to the Incentives page and select **Create Incentive**. In addition to a name and description, incentives include the following attributes:

- _Program_: Only members of this program will be rewarded through the incentive.
- _Start Date Time_: If the incentive is timeboxed, this is the start date and time. For open-ended incentives, this will be blank.
- _End Date Time_: If the incentive is timeboxed, this is the end date and time. For open-ended incentives, this will be blank.
- _Segments_: The segment(s) that will be eligible to be rewarded through the incentive. If the incentive is for all members, leave this empty. If you select multiple segments, any member who is in at least one of them will be eligible.

### Add a Rule

With your incentive created, you can now add a rule. To do so, click on the **\+** icon above the _Incentive Rules_ list.

In addition to a name and description, rules include the following attributes:

- _Source Data_: The data set corresponding to the behavior you want to incentivize, such as Sale or Event.
- _Criteria_: The criteria that the member's behavior must meet in order for it to apply to the rule. Criteria are built upon attributes available on your source data. For example, if your rule only applies to sales over \$50, the criterion would look something like `Net Amount greater than $50`.
- _Criteria Logical Expression_: Determines whether `All criteria must match` for the rule to be applied, or `Any criterion can match`.
- _Type_: `No Competition` rules always reward qualifying members, while `Best Option` rules only reward a qualifying member if no other Best Option rule applies which would give the member a better reward. The "best option" is typically the rule that would give the member more currency. In the event two rules would give the member the same amount of currency, the one with the more generous expiration policy prevails.

### Specify a Reward

Finally, you can specify what the rule will reward to qualifying members. No Competition rules can give currency and instant rewards, while Best Option rules can only give currency.

Currency rewards require the following:

- _Conversion Mode_: 
- _Conversion Value_: 
- _Expiration Mode_: 
- _Expiration Resolution_:

Instant rewards require the following:

- _Reward Mode_:
- _Reward_:
