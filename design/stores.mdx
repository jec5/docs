A store is a location at which a sale or presale occurs.

### Attributes

To add a store, navigate to the Stores page and select **Create Store**. In addition to a name and description, stores have the following attributes:

- _Store Code_: This is how a store will be identified on a sale or presale. It must be unique.
- _Address_: The address fields _Street_, _City_, _State/Province_, _Postal Code_, and _Country_ identify the physical location at which a sale or presale occurred for targeting in rules. They are optional.
- _Is Participating_: This can be used in data set or rule criteria to check whether a store is participating in the program.

### Status

The status of a store is always _Open-Active_. Stores no longer in use can be deleted.
