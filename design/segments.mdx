title: "Segments"

Segments are groupings of members that you can use to target incentives to specific subsets of your customer base. When one or more segments are applied to an incentive, only members that are in at least one of those segments will be able to earn rewards through that incentive.

To add a segment, navigate to the Segments page and select **Create Segment**.

### Add and Remove Members

Segment lists can be managed via API, as well as manually.

You can quickly add and remove members administratively using external IDs. To add or remove members from a segment, access the three-dot menu from the details pane, select **Add Members** or **Remove Members** and enter the external IDs of the members.

You can also modify the segments of a member directly from the member's detail page.

### Statuses

Segments can be in one of two statuses:

- _Open-Active_: Members and incentives can be assigned to the segment.
- _Resolved-Inactive_: The segment is not in use and cannot be applied to incentives.

Segments no longer in use can be deleted.
